### 1. Set Up OP-TEE Environment:


### 2. Define TAC Interface:
In OP-TEE Trusted Application source code, define a TAC interface that specifies the methods for communication between the Normal World (Android app) and the Secure World (OP-TEE Trusted Application). This interface should include methods for sending data from the Normal World to the Secure World.


### 3. Implement TAC Interface in Trusted Application:
Implement the methods defined in the TAC interface in your OP-TEE Trusted Application. These methods will handle the data sent from the Android app.



### 4. Implement Android App:
In your Android app, implement the logic to communicate with the Trusted Application using the TAC interface. This involves setting up communication with the TEE and calling the appropriate methods defined in the TAC interface.

### 5. Set Up Communication with TEE:
Use the Trusted Application Manager (TAM) or other relevant APIs to establish communication with the TEE from your Android app. This typically involves opening a session with the Trusted Application.

### 6. Call TAC Methods:
Once communication is established, call the methods defined in the TAC interface to send data from the Android app to the TEE.

### 7. Handle Data in Trusted Application:
Receive and process the data sent from the Android app in your OP-TEE Trusted Application. Implement the necessary logic to handle the received data in the Secure World.

### 8. Ensure Security:
Ensure that your communication with the TEE is secure and follows best practices for secure communication. This may involve encryption, authentication, and other security measures.
